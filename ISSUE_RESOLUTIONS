    why do we need to do this?
        heroku doesn't know


    in short, we need to
        * create a db with heroku
        * port out local db into heroku's db we created


    1. create app

    2. go to resources within your app page

    3. type "clearDB" (it's free) and submit the order for it

    4. find the HOST, USERNAME, PASSWORD, and DB by going to:

        1. settings
        2. config vars
        3. click reveal config vars
        4. copy the string value

        ex.  mysql://b0r79a57f4e700:0w9m37fe@us-cdbr-east-06.cleardb.net/heroku_f608468476a9858?reconnect=true

            host: 'us-cdbr-east-06.cleardb.net',
            user: 'b0r79a57f4e700',
            password: '0w9m37fe',
            database: 'heroku_f608468476a9858'

        IN MYSQL WORKBENCH NOW

    5. click/create a new connection and paste in those value

    *. [ right click the db (heroku_euhe......) and make it a default schema ?? seems like i didn't have to ]

    7. in your local db, right click the table(s) you want -> copy to clipboard -> create statement

    7. paste that create statement into the heroku db and remove everything after and including "DEFAULT CHARSET..."

    8. if you used "localhost:NUMBER/stuff" in your file remove it and
       past it with the domain name of

       so localhost:NUMBER/stuff -> heroku_project_name.herokuapp.com/stuff
